        This cellular automata implementation is a visual representation of a dynamic system consisting of a grid of cells, each of which can exist as either dead or alive. This simulation follows a set of predefined rules (which can be configured in main.h) to determine the state of each cell in the next iteration based on its current state and the states of its neighboring cells. By iteratively applying these rules, intricate patterns and behaviors emerge, providing suprising complexity and diversity from a seemingly simple set of rules.

        This implementaion uses C++. Even though C++ was chosen, the program could easily be converted to c code, as standard library functions are used sparingly, only for i/o processes. I was originally torn on whether to use the std::vector object to store the world, but decided that given the size of the world being a finite constant that is defined at compile time, char * (character pointers) can easily be used instead.
        <br>
        The logic of the program does not contain any fancy optimisations, it simply calculates every cell every frame, resulting in a consistant big O of n3, where n is the number of cells.
        <br>
        C++ does not have any tools for rendering available by default. Even though I have previous experience in the library, SFML was not chosen. This is where OpenGL came in. With some help from <a class="underline" href="https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">opengl-tutorial.org</a>, I was able to use <a class="underline" href="https://www.glfw.org/">glfw</a> and <a class="underline" href="https://glad.dav1d.de/">glad</a> to render a plane with a texture generated from the world state.

        Have a look at some examples of the program running below.
