        One of my first forays into web development, and probably representative of a lot of work at the time, this 'forum' is a php backend, interacting with a mariadb server. Are the SQL queries sanatized? Hopefully! I do remember hashing and salting the passwords though. Unfortunately, in my folly at the time, I did not save the commands that I used to create the MySQL database, and, as such, this would be really time consuming to set up again, unfortunate, because it was cool. This image is the only living proof of it's past existance, and you'll just have to believe me that it worked. Before you ask, yes, that is a picture of my face with really high contrast.
