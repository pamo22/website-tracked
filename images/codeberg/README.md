# Palette
![](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Design/raw/branch/main/wiki-assets/codeberg-palette.avif)

Blue & Green are the primary colors, each with a more vibrant variant for the brighter tones.  
Red & Yellow are keys to highlight elements and draw focus.  
Black & White embrace the nature of plain text where needed.  
The palette is a guide. Shades (variation of Lightness) of palette colors are valid, too, as the gradients indicate.
